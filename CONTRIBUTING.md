# Contributing to GD399-OSD Projects

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to projects in MICA's GD399 Open Source Design course, which are hosted in the [GD399-OSD Organization](https://github.com/GD399-OSD) on GitHub. These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## Code of Conduct

Be courteous and be constructive. We're all here to learn.

## What should I know before I get started?

### GD399-OSD

GD399-OSD is a course at the Maryland Institute College of Art intended to introduce design students to facets of Free/Libre/Open Source philosophies and to explore how these principles can be applied within the field of visual design.

### Meta-Repositories vs Project Repositories

This organization contains two types of repos: __Meta-Repositories__ and __Project Repositories__.

__Meta-Repositories__ are related to the organizational facets of the GD399-OSD course (i.e. scheduling and resources). These are relevant to the entire class, and their names are prefixed with `GD399-`. Consider these the primary sources of truth for things happening in the course.

__Project Repositories__ are for projects authored by students enrolled in this course. Any number of people may be working on these projects â€” some have only one active contributor, and others are more collaborative.

#### Naming & Description Conventions

There are a few conventions that should be followed when creating new repositories:

- Meta-Repos should be prefaced with `GD399-` for easy scanning in the repo list. For example, `GD399-Scheduling`.
- New Meta-Repositories should be created sparingly, and should be broad in scope to prevent creating too many meta-repositories.
- Repository names can be anything, but it's best if they're somewhat descriptive of the project or concept the repo contains.
- Each repository should have an accurate-as-possible description of what the repo is for, in case people outside the course stumble across our organization.

## How Can I Contribute?

Since there are many different types of projects in this organization, the main guideline to follow is to use common sense and respect when contributing to projects in this organization.

#### Creating Issues

- Feel free to use GitHub issues liberally to have conversations about projects, give working critiques, share resources relevant to each project, and to organize new projects.
- Each issue should have a limited scope. Keep each issue on-topic based on what the issue's title describes, and if the conversation diverges, feel free to create a new issue for the new topic.

#### How Do I Create A Good Issue?

Conversations, ideas, and progress can be tracked in [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).

* **Use a clear and descriptive title** for the issue.
* **Add a descriptive explanation** with the thinking behind the issue you are creating. Include links to additional resources, points of conversation, etc.

#### Pull Requests

If you want to make a change to a meta-repository or to a student's project repository, use a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/). This lets the core contributors of a project review your changes and make sure they are appropriate to merge into the project.
